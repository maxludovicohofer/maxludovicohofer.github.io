"What is fun?" is the most important question for a game designer. The way I see it, fun is a fairly complex idea, indicating any activity provoking happiness in the brain of a person. As a matter of fact, I think fun is an objective, somehow measurable quality, that can be deterministically programmed and even debugged.

While coming up with original and innovative games can be a daunting creative task, I came up with a formula useful to evaluate the fun of a concept:

$ fun = achievement + association + other\ needs $

The need for achievement and association are the two most explored needs of videogames, the first encompassing needs of completion, order and challenge, and the second needs of impersonation, relating, escape and sociality. They can be evaluated as follows:

$ achievement = stress * prospect\ of\ a\ reward * intuitiveness\ of\ the\ game * individual\ need\ for\ achievement $

$ association = relax * coolness\ of\ the\ aesthetic * agency * individual\ need\ to\ associate\ with\ something $

$other\ needs$ would be additional human cravings, such as humor, sex, movement, food, vertigo, needs of the Maslow hierarchy. These are generally less explored, but are in my opinion equally as valid for the concept of fun.

As a game designer, I think there are some parameters that should be considered when designing a videogame. In order of importance:

* Rewards (should be proportional to fun and increase other modifiers to create a loop)
* Stress \ relax (risk \ tension \ urgency)
* Reward prospects (promise rewards \ interest \ curiosity \ motivation)
* Intuitiveness (physics \ controls \ level design \ logic complexity \ fairness)
* Coolness (artistic appeal)
* Agency (options \ possibilities)
