*"What is fun?"* is surely the most important question for a game designer. Many incredible designers have elaborated their own answers, which now define their identities and style.

> Games are a series of interesting decisions

-- Sid Meier

To me, fun indicates any activity provoking happiness in the brain of a person. I think fun is an objective, somehow measurable quality, that can be programmed and even debugged. While coming up with innovative gameplay is a daunting task, I came up with my own formula to assess fun:

$
fun = achievement + association + other\ needs
$

The needs for achievement and association are the most explored. The first encompasses completion, order, and challenge, while the second seeks impersonation, relating, escape, and sociality. I calculate them as follows:

$
achievement = stress * prospect\ of\ a\ reward * intuitiveness\ of\ the\ game * individual\ need\ for\ achievement
$

$
association = relax * coolness\ of\ the\ aesthetic * agency * individual\ need\ to\ associate\ with\ something
$

$ other\ needs $ would be additional human cravings, such as humor, sex, movement, food, vertigo, needs of the [Maslow hierarchy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). These are generally less explored, but are equally as valid for the concept of fun.

I think there are a few parameters that should be considered when designing games. In order of importance:

* Rewards (should be proportional to fun and increase other modifiers to create a loop)
* Stress and relax (risk, tension, and urgency)
* Reward prospects (promise rewards, interest, curiosity, and motivation)
* Intuitiveness (physics, controls, level design, logic complexity, and fairness)
* Coolness (artistic appeal)
* Agency (options and possibilities)

In my own designs, I come up with an idea organically, usually by *"It would be cool if..."*, then debug the idea with these formulas. Even if I complete a prototype and something isn't fun, I try to analyze the game through this lens.
