The best videogames can be approached in two ways: as *activities* and as *entertainment*.

![[Breath of the Wild(https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild)] is a masterclass at balancing both approaches.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q9sAzTOjl6s)

As activities, games impart a rhythm to a player's thought process and physical actions. I think this is the essence to deep flow state and peak game design. It constitutes the instinctive feeling of satisfaction truly great games provide.

On the other hand, games as entertainment are incredible to witness. A cinematic experience gives players a long lasting impact and helps with marketing. It's important that a game is as *wow* as can be, given its artistic direction. If everyone involved prioritizes the wow factor, the result is sure to provoke a strong emotional response.

In my eyes, activity and entertainment are followed by flow and immersion. While flow stresses the player's brain, immersion calls for a relaxing time. I separate the two aspects in my games, pacing the gameplay to focus on one at a time.
