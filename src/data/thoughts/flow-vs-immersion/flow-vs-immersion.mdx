I divide videogames into two categories, that the greatest of them all balance effortlessly: activity and entertainment.

As an activity, a game's goal is to impart a rhythm, closely following the player's thought process and physical actions. I think that once this rhythm is achieved, this is the essence to true flow state and the perfect game design. To me, this constitutes the instinctive feeling of satisfaction that a player has when playing a truly great game.

On the other hand, entertainment games must make great cinema. These cinematic aspects will give the player a long lasting impact and also help a lot with the marketing. It's fundamental that a game is as cool as can be, given a certain artistic direction. As a game designer this is not my main responsibility, but I think every single person working on a videogame should prioritize coolness whenever possible. If this is done right, the result will be a game that makes players dream about this fantastical world that has been created. More and more, I think characters are starting to shine when compared to the plot of a videogame. I'm sure a great character goes a long way.
