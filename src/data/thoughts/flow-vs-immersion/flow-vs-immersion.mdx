The ideal videogame can be approached in two ways, that the greatest of them all handle effortlessly: as an *activity* and as an *entertainment*.

{/* TODO GAMEPLAY GAME, LIKE SEKIRO */}

As an activity, a game imparts a rhythm to the player's thought process and physical actions. I think this is the essence to deep flow state and peak game design. It constitutes the instinctive feeling of satisfaction truly great games give.

{/* TODO CINEMATIC GAME, LIKE OOKAMI */}

On the other hand, games as entertainment are incredible to witness. A cinematic experience gives players a long lasting impact and helps with marketing. It's fundamental that a game is as *wow* as can be given its artistic direction. If everyone working on a game prioritizes the wow factor, the result is sure to provoke a strong emotional response.

{/* TODO BALANCED GAME, LIKE ZELDA */}

In my eyes, activity and entertainment are parallel to flow and immersion. While flow stresses a player's brain, immersion calls for a relaxing time. I separate the two aspects in my games, pacing the gameplay to focus on one at a time.
