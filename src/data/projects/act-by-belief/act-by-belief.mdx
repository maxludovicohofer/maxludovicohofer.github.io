{/* Reason to exist, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

Current game AI is often a checklist that settles on specific behavior. While maybe easy to debug, this does not follow a fluid thought process, easily resulting in robotic behavior. Reusing these imperative decision trees can be daunting, as they couple AI with gameplay. With Act By Belief, I aim to address these issues through a [Maslow hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)-inspired declarative method that is performant, easy to use and debug.

## Design

{/* Description, target and explanation of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Act By Belief is a decision tree-based workflow for natural thought. It's useful for agents that require a personality and follow reactive thought processes. For robotic or immutable behavior, traditional methods would be preferable. In this system, agents are split into brain and body.

### Brain

The brain is the belief and personality processor.

```csharp
Brain brain = new(body);
```

A brain has input beliefs that sense data.

```csharp
Belief<Vector3> Position = new();

// Update belief
Position.Sense(transform.position);
```

Beliefs can also interpret signals from sensors or existing beliefs. Signals contain the data of the brain and a dependency graph, assuring only beliefs that need to be updated are.

```csharp
// Senses a transform, holds a vector
Belief<Transform, Vector3> PlayerPosition = new(signal => signal.sensed.position);

PlayerPosition.Sense(player.transform);
```

But most importantly, a brain has needs that it wants to fulfill. Need beliefs are special beliefs that estimate the urgency of a need from 0 to 1, given the current signal. Also, the `Need` static class contains estimate functions.

```csharp
// The AI needs to kiss the player more and more as the player gets near
var kissPlayer = brain.Need(
    new(signal => Need.Near(signal.Get(Position), signal.Get(PlayerPosition))),
    // Needs to kiss out of love
    Motive.Love
);
```

The motive of a need can be survival, love, or achievement, in order of importance following Maslow's pyramid. It's used as a weight to compare needs. Finally, needs are used in output beliefs, read by the body to execute actions.

```csharp
// If needs to kiss, target is player
// Else stand still
Belief<Vector3> TargetPosition = new(
    signal =>
        signal.Get(kissPlayer) > Need.ABSENT
            ? signal.Get(PlayerPosition)
            : signal.Get(Position)
);
```

### Body

Beliefs that always represent reality can be moved to the body.

```csharp
// Can be moved from brain to body
Belief<Vector3> Position = new();

// Add brain reference
AI brain = new(this);
```

At last, a body acts upon the output beliefs of the brain.

```csharp
var targetPath = brain.TargetPosition.Value - Position.Value;

// Kiss if in range, else move toward target
if(targetPath.magnitude < 1)
    Kiss();
else
    controller.Move(movementSpeed * targetPath.normalized);
```

* The system comes with a fully documented API and in-game debugger targeted at Unity programmers. The debugger displays a text overlay with the quasi-realtime beliefs of every brain, and brain IDs on top of their bodies. A simple code demonstration of basic functionality is also provided.
* The codebase amounts to around 1500 lines including documentation. The API was designed for a smooth developer experience and ease of extension. Also, the Act By Belief workflow can be achieved in existing decision tree systems without relying on this API.
* The biggest development challenge was C#'s type system, forcing me to introduce some slow reflection. To save on performance, I plan to migrate this system to a C++ library in the near future.
