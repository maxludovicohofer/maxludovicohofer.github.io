{/* Reason to exist, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

Current game AI is more often than not a checklist that settles on specific behaviors. While this is maybe easy to debug, it fundamentally does not follow a sensible thought process, thus easily creating robotic characters. Also, reusing and replicating these imperative thought processes is very difficult, instead coupling the AI strongly with the gameplay. With this tool, I aim to address all these problems through a [Maslow pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)-based declarative infrastructure, that is performant, easy to use and to debug.

## Design

{/* Description, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

I use this system to create an AI which can react intelligently in any situation, following a natural thought process.

{/* First point: ux, second point: code, third point: development challenges. Split in max 4 points if too long */}

* The whole system is based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
