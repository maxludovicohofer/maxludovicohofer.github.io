{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

{/* TODO */}

Inspired by Titanfall's infamous time travel mechanic, we came up with a puzzle sidescroller, where the player can change the character's “eyesight” to switch from normal world to a fantasy cat world. In each world, some level elements will be hidden, while others will be active, allowing for a smooth and fast puzzle gameplay.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Mobile sidescroller, where the platforming is achieved by swapping between the "cat world" and the "human world". This prototype was commissioned by a company, requesting a mobile platformer-like game, featuring an odd-eyed cat character. Also, particular emphasis was placed on the technical aspects of the game and making the character's unique features shine.

* Levels are composed dynamically based on an estimated skill level, increasing or decreasing the difficulties of the puzzles. Also, for the prototype we kept graphic fidelity to a minimum to maximize compatibility with older devices.
* Since the game's levels had to be procedurally generated, I came up with a dynamic difficulty algorithm that created a skill profile for the user. Given a constraint of 30 seconds to complete a level, this algorithm sequentially placed puzzle patterns based on their declared difficulty and the skill profile of the player.
* Given the simple design and limited time, instead of a GDD I drew all level elements and their expected behavior on a blackboard for the team to see. This merged the brainstorming and design phases, helping with time.
