{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

Duchessa is an easily scared humanoid cat, and when she hears a loud noise, her instincts tell her to run away as fast as she can. Her eyes, one yellow and one blue, allow her to access another dimension: the cat realm. Using this power, she needs to avoid pitfalls and find a hiding spot in time.

## Design

{/* Genre, target, and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Duchessa's World is a mobile sidescroller where the character moves between two realms. It's a simple rhythm game aimed at children and adults alike, with a small and addictive game loop. The prototype was commissioned by a company who dictated the target platform, genre, and protagonist, with particular emphasis on procedural content. Our goal was to design a casual game that was at the same time approachable and hard to master.

* The player can traverse platforms by moving, jumping, and switching realms. Timing, momentum, and knowledge of block patterns are key to completing a level without the timer running out. Duchessa has three lives that get reset after each completed stage.
* The game is organized in 30-seconds levels with dynamic difficulty, assembled at runtime from different block patterns. Each block pattern has an associated difficulty that gets compared to the player's skill, evaluated based on their proficiency at the game. Block patterns are composed of blocks of the two realms and movement-altering platforms, like an uplifting tornado.
* Given the limited time and simple design, I replaced the GDD with drawing each platform behavior on a blackboard for the team to see, combining brainstorming and design. Also, we kept graphic fidelity to a minimum to maximize device compatibility.
