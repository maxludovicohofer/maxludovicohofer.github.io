{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

In the galactic empire of Madreterra, humanity evolved to avoid conflict. Instead, political discussion is resolved through covert planetary wars waged by the richest, marketed as land reclamation efforts. These private military forces are equipped with plant-spawning bullets and the latest tech, enabled by the life-generating material called Angel.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

This prototype is an online deathmatch third-person shooter, based on bullets that spawn assets and gravitational boots. It was designed for competitive players who enjoy fast gameplay and high skill ceilings. Also, this project was made to evolve my mechanics and online development skills, and speed up my prototyping.

* Before each game, players choose a bullet type and special skill type, while jumping always gravitates the character towards their predicted destination. Bullets spawn plants on impact that the player can use for defense or terrain. An enemy is defeated if hit 3 times, and players possess auto-reloading magazines. At the same time, special skills are tactical tools that keep the game dynamic, for example a teleport.
* The 4v4 free-for-all matches take place on arid asteroids. During the game, bullets will change the landscape considerably, transforming a mostly flat surface into an intricate vertical jungle, increasing the skill required to win. I also experimented with diegetic UI, that can have visibility problems solved by a separate render pass.
* Since Unreal Engine and its marketplace packages did not support gravity switching, I had to code dynamic gravity from the ground up. This eventually evolved into inferring the player's desired destination based on their inputs, and dynamically adjusting the trajectory and gravity to execute a smooth and intuitive jump. Also, I organized my codebase and assets into reusable drag and drop components that 10x my prototyping speed to this day.
