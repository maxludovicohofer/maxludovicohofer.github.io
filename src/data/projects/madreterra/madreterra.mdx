{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

In the galactic empire of Madreterra, humanity evolved to avoid conflict. Instead, political discussion is resolved through covert planetary wars waged by the richest, marketed as land reclamation efforts. These private military forces are equipped with plant-spawning bullets and the latest tech, enabled by the life-generating material called Angel.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

This prototype is an online deathmatch third-person shooter, based on bullets that spawn assets and gravitational boots. It was designed for competitive players who enjoy fast gameplay and a high skill ceiling. Also, this project was made to evolve my mechanics and online development skills.

The concept is to make an e-sports grade third person shooter, with fast paced 4-player free-for-all matches that take place on planets. When bullets hit the ground, they create structures that the player can then walk on, by switching his gravity. Before the game, players can select 3 skills. During the game, every 2 minutes one skill will be randomly selected and applied to the player.

Given the depth of the mechanics, I still created a full-fledged GDD for myself. Also, I made some gameplay flow and game theory graphs, to avoid stalemates and exploits. Since I'm also committed to the artistic side, I made some concept art to gain a better understanding of the visual identity and elements I want the game to have.

* Since Unreal Engine does not support switching gravity, I had to create some custom code to allow for smooth gravity transitions. This code eventually evolved in a deeper mechanic that works by selecting the surface you want to stand on, and the game figuring out the trajectory and necessary gravity to achieve the desired outcome position.
* I used this game as an opportunity to refactor my codebase into auto-consistent drag and drop components, to drastically improve development speed on future prototypes and games.
