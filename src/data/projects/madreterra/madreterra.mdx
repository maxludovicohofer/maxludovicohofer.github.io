{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

In the galactic empire of Madreterra, humanity evolved to avoid conflict. Instead, political discussion is resolved through covert planetary wars waged by the richest, marketed as land reclamation efforts. These private military forces are equipped with plant-spawning bullets and the latest tech, enabled by the life-generating material called Angel.

## Design

{/* Genre, target, and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

This prototype is an online deathmatch third-person shooter based on bullets that spawn assets and gravitational boots. It was designed for competitive players who enjoy fast gameplay and high skill ceilings. Also, this project was made to speed up my prototyping and evolve my mechanics and online development skills.

* Before each game, players choose a bullet type and special skill type, while jumping always gravitates the character towards their predicted destination. Bullets grow plants on impact, that players can use for defense or terrain. Players are defeated if hit 3 times, and possess auto-reloading magazines. At the same time, special skills are tactical tools that keep the game dynamic, for example a teleport.
* The 4v4 free-for-all matches take place on arid asteroids. During the game, bullets transform the flat landscape into an intricate vertical jungle, increasing the skill required to win. I also experimented with diegetic UI affected by visibility issues, possibly solved by a separate render pass.
* Since Unreal Engine and its marketplace packages did not support gravity switching, I had to code dynamic gravity from the ground up. This eventually evolved into inferring the player's desired destination based on their inputs, and dynamically adjusting the trajectory and gravity to execute a smooth and intuitive jump. Also, I organized my codebase and assets into reusable drag and drop components that 10x my prototyping speed to this day.
