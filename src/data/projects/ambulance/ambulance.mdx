{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

The concept was to be an ambulance driver whose goal is to pick up patients and deliver them to the hospital. Unfortunately, the ambulance would be so difficult to drive that in the process you would necessarily hit some people on the road to reach the goal in time. As a bonus, the jump mechanic could be exploited to make the vehicle fly.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Ambulance is a driving game, where you save lives with an out of control ambulance, involuntarily running over pedestrians. This game was made for a school game jam, with a theme of “unfortunately, you're the bad guy”. We figured a silly game would make up for the lack of polish and go well with our target audience.

{/* First point: character, second point: world, third point: development challenges. Split in max 4 points if too long */}

* To give the game some repeatable content, I created a procedural map generation algorithm, organizing the map into tiles. Also, the target and delivery point were spawned randomly on the map.
