{/* Description of the game, as short as possible */}

A little girl living in a village is unjustly punished by her patriarchal community, and runs away into the nearby woods. As she wanders through the never ending trees, she will be protected by a dark mysterious entity, that grants her the power to turn into the fantastical animals she encounters along the way. Struggling to resist her instincts, she will turn more and more from a frightened human to a vengeful beast.

## Design

{/* First point: goal and target of the project, second point: character, third point: world */}

* I envisioned Lolita specifically to improve my immersive design, worldbuilding, and narrative skills. Also, I wanted to challenge myself by designing for a target audience interested in the cinematic aspects rather than the fun of the experience.
* Lolita's skills are her transformations, first used for stealth, then for action. The game also starts out encouraging stealth gameplay, but reduces punishment for being aggressive as the character becomes more powerful, to reflect her evolution. The challenge of the design was to come up with elegant skills useful both for stealth and action. For example, the ghost butterfly can make the character pass through objects and be invisible, but it can also be used to pass through enemies and attack them from behind. Each animal has its unique feeling, thus creating navigation minigames by changing controls and perspective. To simulate the feeling of fighting instincts, I set up the skills as potentially involuntary actions, for example staring for too long at enemies, or pressing the run button. At the beginning of the game, you fight these controls; but as the story goes on, you learn how to use them offensively.
* I automated level design elements to allow for quick iterations. To make countering the AI as intuitive as possible, I created easily tweakable behavior that mimics human perception. Also, every sound and UI element are placed in the world, so that the player can fully immerse in the game's magical forest.
