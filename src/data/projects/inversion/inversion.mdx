{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

A spaceship robot's job is to ensure the vessel's integrity. When a critical failure occurs near a black hole, you and a colleague in the opposite part of the ship are woken up to fix the issue. Mysteriously armed with the power of altering physical properties, you will uncover the spacecraft's story and secure its trajectory.

## Design

{/* Genre, target, and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Inversion is a puzzle game based on two physics-inverting characters. It is targeted towards videogame beginners and movie buffs, that may enjoy pocket-sized stories and simple control schemes. The design was a study in minimalism, atmosphere, and slow pacing.

{/* First point: character, second point: world, third point: development challenges. Split in max 4 points if too long */}

* Players interact with the black hole to switch characters. They solve puzzles by selecting one object with each robot and negating properties such as gravity, polarity, and movement direction.
* Inversion is designed as a meditative experience. The black hole is a cosmic horror weenie central to the story, the gameplay, and the feeling of emptiness. Furthermore, puzzle rooms are thematically linked to the story, following an essential level design that gives space to thought.
* Since the inversion action occurs after both robots settle on a selection, only the last character's effect is shown. In hindsight, both effects should have been visible, ideally transitioning the game to co-op.
