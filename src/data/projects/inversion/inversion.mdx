This is a prototype I designed for the level design class at school. The planimetry of the environment was provided for us, and our team decided to create a slow paced cosmic horror puzzle game. I used this opportunity to focus more on the artistic side of game design, and use a simple gameplay to aid the story.

The reason I went in a slow paced direction, was because I believe cosmic horror is a feeling that only gets stronger the more you think about it, therefore in this game it was crucial that the player would really be absorbed in the hypnotic emptiness of the black hole. The puzzle game design focuses on one “verb”, inverting, with meaning given by the objects the player is inverting. For example, the player could invert magnetic poles, gravity, direction, … This mechanic would be symbolic for the game’s ethical theme.
We developed the game based on a script and a map, where we laid out the 3 levels and the game’s progression. Also, we used a kanban to organize our work.

## Notable contributions

* Since Unreal’s global illumination produces noisy artifacts with the neon tube internal lighting that we chose, we had to rely on fake illumination that simulated the tubes instead.
* The black hole acts both as a weenie and as a gameplay element to switch character. Every room in the ship has its own theme to make them more memorable.
