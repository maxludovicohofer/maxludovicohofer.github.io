{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

A spaceship robot's job is to ensure the vessel's integrity. When a critical failure occurs near a black hole, you and a partner in the opposite part of the ship are woken up to fix the issue. Mysteriously armed with the power of altering physics, you will uncover the spacecraft's story and secure its trajectory.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design. Split in max 2 sections if too long, divided by a media */}

Inversion is a puzzle game, based on two characters that invert physical properties. It is targeted towards videogame beginners and movie buffs, that may enjoy pocket-sized stories and simple control schemes. The design was a study in minimalism, atmosphere, and slow pacing.

{/* TODO */}

* The reason I went in a slow paced direction, was because I believe cosmic horror is a feeling that only gets stronger the more you think about it, therefore in this game it was crucial that the player would really be absorbed in the hypnotic emptiness of the black hole. The puzzle game design focuses on one “verb”, inverting, with meaning given by the objects the player is inverting. For example, the player could invert magnetic poles, gravity, direction, … This mechanic would be symbolic for the game's ethical theme.
* The black hole acts both as a weenie and as a gameplay element to switch character. Every room in the ship has its own theme to make them more memorable.
* Since Lumen produces noisy artifacts with the neon tube internal lighting that we chose, we had to rely on fake illumination that simulated the tubes instead.
