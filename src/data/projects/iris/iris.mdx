{/* Description of the game, as short as possible. Max 1 section */}

In a gothic industrial earth, a vision transformed a child into a prophet, teaching that escape from reality purifies the soul. Every 111 years, believers corrupt their bodies, claim three soul-bound artifacts, and face a bloody ritual for a fourth.
