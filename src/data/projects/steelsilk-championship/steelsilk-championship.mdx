{/* Description of the game, as short as possible */}

In the year 2980, a much anticipated robotics competition takes place: a team of miniature remote-control arachnoids fend off the creepy crawlies of three different biomes. Before each round, enemies receive a random bonus, and each spider has to choose a bonus for itself. To win, the team must counter enemies, make good use of each character's unique strengths, and form a solid strategy.

## Design

{/* Genre, target and goal of the design */}

Steelsilk Championship is a couch co-op rougelite shoot 'em up, where victory is achieved by resisting three hoardes.

{/* First point: character, second point: world. Split if too long, in max 4 points */}

* This is the master thesis of my game dev class. A game outline was authored for us by our professors and the concept art class.
Reflecting on the great co-op experiences I had in my life, I think the best were the ones where I bonded more with my real life partner, through trust and shared effort. Since my design is usually focused on maximizing immersion and using fun as a tool, I had to swap my priorities in order to achieve an arcade-like experience with minimum downtime. In this way, my goal was to trigger emotions and reactions between the players in real life, instead of relying on the videogame.
* This meant that cooperation and trust had to be fundamental for progressing the game, and heavily rewarded. I designed the game to be basically impossible to beat if the players didn't constantly look out for each other. For example, their skills would be at their most useful if coordinated together: the “boom” spider has a timed explosion skill, but only the “fast” spider has the speed required to group enemies together. Enemies that are more effective against the “fast” spider must be prioritized by the “boom” spider, and enemies that are stronger against the “boom” spider must be distracted by the “fast” spider. Also, cards are best chosen with cooperation in mind. Finally, when a player dies, he must repair himself, while the other player tries to survive. This allows for zero downtime even if dead, and brings a shared feeling of tension, instead of focusing on the individuality of the surviving player.
* I wrote the GDD we used during development based on communication with the creators of the base concept, while greatly expanding its specificity, features and philosophy. This helped tremendously in contrast with the original concept document, because artists and developers were now aligned both technically and in terms of emotional design goals. Given the project's unpaid and commissioned context, I tried to focus more on the team's morale and involvement more than the project's completion per se. I held daily reviews, where we colored sentences in the GDD based on their state of completion. In this situation, I found it to be a more effective alternative to the standard Kanban board. Seeing the document become greener and greener gave the team a big morale boost and reminded them to check out the document, giving them a bigger sense of involvement in the game's overall progress and vision.
* Since the tech team was composed solely of people with no prior work experience, I mentored each member to achieve an acceptable quality standard. This was only possible by setting strict guidelines at the beginning, and only allowing more flexibility as the team gained a deeper understanding of the concepts. Since micromanagement usually affects morale negatively, I kept code reviews on a weekly basis.
* Since the art team experienced a long delay at the beginning of the project, I set up IT infrastructure to parallelize our work and theirs. Also, this required setting up a well-defined tech art pipeline to export assets and textures consistently and efficiently (for example, a specific kind of texture packing).
* I set up QA to have three different stages: play tested by tech team, play tested by art team, finally play tested by externals. This detected a fair number of bugs and usability defects, while keeping any inactive art team members busy.
* Since there were a lot of ideas for cards, I set up a data-driven system so that even artists could define cards to be added, based on the spiders' attributes.
* To motivate the art team and always keep them updated, we held weekly reviews and retrospectives, in true scrum spirit. Sometimes, if big changes were made during the week, I arranged exceptional meetings with the art team and displayed the new features. On the other hand, I brought ideas and visions from the art team to the tech team, to assert their feasibility and foster enthusiasm and productive communication.
