Unsatisfied with the current state of game AI, I programmed a high-performance decision tree-like AI system that works by declaring an AI’s beliefs on the world (subjective data based on senses), which change the active needs of the AI (depending on the importance of the need). The needs define the actions the AI will take to satisfy that need. The whole system is based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. I use this system to create an AI which can react intelligently in any situation, following a human thought process.
