title: Flow and immersion
---

Videogames are to me subdivided into two macro aspects, that the greatest of them all balance effortlessly: sport and entertainment.
As a sport, a videogame's sole goal is to give a rhythm to the player, closely following the rhythm of the player's thought process and physical actions. As a game designer, I think that once this rhythm is achieved, this is the essence to true flow state and the perfect game design. I think this constitutes the instinctive feeling of satisfaction that a player has when playing a truly great game.

On the other hand, I also take into consideration all cinematic aspects of a videogame, which constitute the entertainment. These aspects will give the player a long lasting impact and also help a lot with the marketing. It's fundamental that a game is as cool as can be, given a certain artistic direction. As a game designer, this is not my main responsibility, but I think every single person working on a videogame should prioritize coolness whenever possible. If this is done right, the result will be a game that really captures you and makes players dream about this fantastical world that has been created. More and more, I think characters are starting to shine, when compared to the plot of a videogame. I'm sure a great character goes a long way.

In conclusion, the goal of my work is to maximize flow and immersion, in every possible way. This is my game design philosophy, regardless of genre.
